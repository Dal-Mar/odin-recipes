# odin-recipes
repository for Odins odin-recipes project
In this project I'm going to build a small recipe website. This will practice my 
basic HTML skills and beginner use of GitHub.


 Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the 
 current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have 
 completed it. I can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project.
